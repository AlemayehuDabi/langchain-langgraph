# MEIM: Multi-partition Embedding Interaction Beyond Block Term Format

**Authors:** Xin Wang, et al.

## Abstract
Knowledge graph embeddings benefit from expressive interaction models. We propose **MEIM**, a tensor-decomposition-inspired method that partitions embeddings into multiple groups and models interactions beyond block-term decomposition.

## Key Ideas
- Multi-partitioned embedding representation.
- Richer interactions while controlling complexity.
- Outperforms baselines on link prediction tasks.

## Excerpt
> "Our approach balances expressive power with efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale knowledge graphsâ€¦"
